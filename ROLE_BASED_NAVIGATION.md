# Role-Based Navigation Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented role-based navigation for the admin panel where different menu items are shown based on user roles.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated AdminSidebar.tsx
- Added `superAdminOnly` property to sidebar items that should only be visible to super admins
- Modified the filtering logic to show different menu items based on user role

### 2. Role-Based Menu Items

#### For ADMIN role (regular admin):
- ✅ Dashboard
- ✅ Courts  
- ✅ Bookings
- ✅ My Profile

#### For SUPER_ADMIN role:
- ✅ Dashboard
- ✅ Players (super admin only)
- ✅ Courts
- ✅ Bookings  
- ✅ Sessions (super admin only)
- ✅ Payments (super admin only)
- ✅ Analytics (super admin only)
- ✅ Settings (super admin only)
- ✅ My Profile

## How It Works

1. **Role Detection**: The `useAdminAuth` hook extracts the user role from the JWT token's `cognito:groups` field
2. **Permission Check**: The `hasPermission` function checks if the user has the required role
3. **Menu Filtering**: The sidebar filters menu items based on the `superAdminOnly` flag and user permissions
4. **Dynamic Display**: Only authorized menu items are rendered in the sidebar

## Testing

To test the role-based navigation:

1. **As ADMIN**: Login with admin credentials - should see only Dashboard, Courts, Bookings, and My Profile
2. **As SUPER_ADMIN**: Login with super admin credentials - should see all menu items

## Code Structure

```typescript
// Menu item with role restriction
{
  title: 'Players',
  href: '/admin/players',
  icon: Users,
  superAdminOnly: true, // Only visible to super admins
}

// Filtering logic
const filteredItems = sidebarItems.filter(item => {
  if (!item.superAdminOnly) return true; // Show to all admins
  return hasPermission('SUPER_ADMIN'); // Only show to super admins
});
```

## Security Notes

- Role-based UI restrictions are implemented on the frontend
- Backend API endpoints should also have proper role-based authorization
- The `RequireRole` component already protects the entire admin area
- Individual routes may need additional role checks if needed
